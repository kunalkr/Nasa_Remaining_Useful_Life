    "The general setup for the problem is a common one: we have a single table of sensor observations over time. Now that collecting information is easier than ever, most industries have already generated time-series type problems by the way that they store data. As such, it is crucial to be able to handle data in this form. Thankfully, built-in functionality from Featuretools handles time varying data well.\n",

    "We'll demonstrate an end-to-end workflow using a Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set from NASA. This notebook demonstrates a rapid way to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an engine using an initial dataframe of time-series data. There are three sections of the notebook:\n",
